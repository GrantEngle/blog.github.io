# blog.github.io
This was created as a test, but now I need to figure out how to organize posts and do cool stuff like that.
Or should I just start a new repo and page for every blog post?
Hmmmm. Then, I could have the headline in the URL of every post I put on here, and that seems like a good thing to do for SEO.
