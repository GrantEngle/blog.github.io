<p>Bad things are going to happen to you and your business.</p>

<p>That’s not us being pessimistic, gloomy or mean. That’s just a fact of life. Here are just a few problems SaaS startups commonly face:</p>

<ol>
<li>A new hire doesn’t work out</li>
<li>A marketing initiative doesn’t generate as many leads as you hoped</li>
<li>You finally get the recognition you deserve, but the wave of new web traffic breaks your product and you look foolish and unprofessional</li>
</ol>

<p>While those first two problems are very, very difficult to predict and almost completely subjective before the benefit of hindsight, the third issue can almost always be prevented.</p>

<p>Websites and applications are more complex than ever, and the API economy is one of the fastest growing spaces in technology. </p>

<p>That’s why performance testing is absolutely imperative for any company that relies on its Internet presence. (So, basically everyone)</p>

<p>We recently came across a webinar hosted by the great team at Datto: “5 Keys to Creating a Disaster Recovery Plan for SMBs.”</p>

<p>The webinar discussed how companies can recover from work stoppages due to natural disasters and other circumstances, and that got us thinking about our users and the entire SaaS landscape.</p>

<p>One of the key factors of being able to recover from a disaster is to prepare for it, and that message truly resonates with Load Impact.</p>

<p>Performance testing your website, app and API can be the difference between thousands (millions!) of dollars in revenue and a real difference in the way you’re perceived by customers.</p>

<p>Here are a few tips from us on how to mitigate your risk of encountering a web performance disaster:</p>

<p>A wise action figure once said, “Knowing is half the battle.”</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1681264/blog-files/GI_Joe.jpg" alt="Load Impact load testing"></p>

<p>GI Joe was actually talking about performance testing. You didn't know?</p>

<p>Set performance goals for your web product. Look at best practices in your industry and go through the purchasing flow at competitors’ websites and get a gauge for how they’re performing.</p>

<p>You want to be fast, but you also want to look good in the process. Are your competitors achieving that? Surely you can, too.</p>

<a id="make-a-plan" class="anchor" href="#make-a-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Make a Plan</h2>

<p>You know what you want to accomplish. You know what your competitors are doing. Now it’s time to get to the nitty gritty of performance testing.</p>

<p>Create user scenario scripts based on your research and what you expect your users to do when they interact with your product.</p>

<p>We give users a few ways to do that, including our awesome Chrome Extension and our Proxy Recorder. Simply use one of those recorders, act like a user would on your website or application, and you’ll be able to scale up from there.</p>

<p>If you’re preparing for a big marketing event or a sudden burst of traffic, make sure you give yourself plenty of time to create and test a few different user scenarios and run several tests.</p>

<p>There are two reasons for this:</p>

<p>Pretty much every user is going to act a little differently from the others, so that’s how you want to test — realism is key</p>

<p>Running several tests creates a performance trend. The more data points the better, and it’ll be easier for you to pinpoint what changes in your website, app, API or infrastructure created a change in your customer-facing performance</p>

<p>You’ve started running tests, you’ve gathered information and now you want to make intelligent decisions about optimizations.</p>

<p>The fact is, interpreting results from performance testing isn’t the easiest part of the process. However, you’re lucky enough to have some friends in the industry who will always be here to help you! (That’s us)</p>

<p>Check out this guide for interpreting results to get you started, and if you need any more help, you can feel free to contact our Support Team any time for additional help.</p>

<p>In the crazy world of SaaS and the Internet in general, bad things are bound to happen, but if you’ve prepared yourself through performance testing, that’s just one less thing you have to worry about.</p>
